# Incomplete implementation of STALP

This is an incomplete implementation of [STALP: Style Transfer with Auxiliary Limited Pairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10501).

## What's incomplete about this implementation?

I don't know. I'm fairly new to machine learning and this is my best attempt at implementing what's described on the paper. However the output is quite flickery and not like the paper's output, so I'm giving up on implementing this for now. If anyone has better expertise please feel free to do a pull request, fork this or anything you want really.
